               <p> The history of Jakubowy Hotel begins in 1920, when the land on which the hotel stands today was bought by Jakub Kowalski - the owner of a building supplies store.
			   Jakub dreamed of creating a place where his customers could rest and relax after a hard day's work.</p>

               <p>In the 1920s, Jacob began construction of his dream hotel. He hired excellent architects and craftsmen to create a building that would be a highlight of the city. The hotel was built in a classic style, with beautiful architectural details and elegant finishes.
			   Inside were spacious rooms with panoramic windows, and there was a roof terrace overlooking the sea.</p>

               <p>During World War II, the hotel was closed and taken over by German troops. After the war, the James Hotel was taken over by the government and was used as a hospital for wounded soldiers for several years.
After the war ended, the hotel was handed back to the Kowalski family, but due to the difficult economic situation and lack of funds for renovations, the hotel remained closed for several years.</p>

			   James Hotel gained a reputation as one of the best hotels in the city, enjoying great popularity among tourists and local residents.</p>
